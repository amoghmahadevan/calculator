Made a Simple 4 Function Calculator using all the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS learned from The Odin Project  
Improved both Implementation and Problem Solving Skills (i.e. extreme cases, handling 2 numbers at a time, incorporating button click and keydown, handling floating point error, box resizing to number overflow)  
Overall, developed a firm grasp of basic fundamentals of HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS
